# Technical test

This projects contains the implemation of a technical test.

It consists of a Single Page Application in React.js, backed by a .Net 10.0 REST API, to handle data storage.

GenAI was used as a research tool, primarily around modern .Net tooling and challenging design decisions (to ensure the decisions were "the best", a bit like the rubbber duck approach).
All code was updated to the developer's taste.
