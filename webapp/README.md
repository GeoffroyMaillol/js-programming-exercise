# Serahc user data web app

This is the implementation of a Single Page Application that allows to enter user data and search for existing data. 

It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

React was used to develop the UI to go with the developer's familiarity.
Next.js was selected as it is a common framework for React apps.

MaterialUI was selected as the main UI library because of its flexibility.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies with:
```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
